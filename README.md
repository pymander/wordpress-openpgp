# Installation

To install this plugin from source, please download it from the Github
project page.

# Acknowledgements

This plugin uses OpenPGP.js, which can be found here: http://openpgpjs.org/

A version is included with the plugin so that this software doesn't
have to worry about API changes and so that end users don't have to
worry about downloading multiple pieces of software.
